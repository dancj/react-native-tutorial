## Setup
ref: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Need to have current versions of nodejs, JDK8, xCode.

Must have android paths set up in $PATH env variable.

Run things with npx, which uses an online version of react-native somehow.  For example:
`npx react-native run-ios`

## AWS

https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/setup/q/integration/react-native
just run `amplify init` and follow the wizard



## Running

```
To run in emulator, must have android emulator set up in AVD and run it first!  Need to set up iphone sim in xCode also.  

// pick one...
npx react-native start
npx react-native run-ios
```
